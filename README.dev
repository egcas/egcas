# egcas-meta
meta project (top-level project) for egcas 


Dependencies for compiling egcas (on Ubuntu 14.04LTS):
======================================================
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
sudo apt-get install bison
sudo apt-get install flex
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install cmake
pip install cogapp


Dependencies to install for development:
========================================
- Kubuntu 14.04 LTS or 16.04
- install Qt Creator 2.0.2 (Qt 5.5) from www.qt.io  OR install the following packages: sudo apt-get install qtcreator qt5-default qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev
- sudo apt-get install flex bison build-essential cmake maxima python-pip ssh git libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libboost-dev sbcl texinfo
- sudo pip install cogapp
- build with Qt Creator or with following commands
on command line (cmake prefix path must be set to Qt libs installation to work):
  cd <BUILD_DIR>
  - cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/ .. 
    OR (depending on which Qt Creator you insalled - packages or Qt Creator direct from Digia)  
    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/ ..
  - make

create e.g. a debian package:
========================================
- configure cmake with above commands
- make package 

use different maxima kernel
===========================
To use a maxima kernel from a different installation path (not from package provided) the following environment variable must be set (including maxima binary):
MAXIMA_BINARY_PATH=/usr/bin/maxima

Search for bugs with clang static analysis:
================================================
ATTENTION: This does NOT work on (K)Ubuntu 14.04LTS!!! However it works with Kubuntu 15.10 ...
- clang must be installed
start static analysis with following command in main directory:
./static_analysis.sh
  
Building with MXE (crosscompiling for windows) on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit:
================================================
To setup the neccessary mxe environment for windows crosscompiling, execute setup_mxe.sh in the win subdirectory.
As next step the cmake build environment has to be set up. For this to setup execute cmake_win.sh also in the win subdirectory.

Now the required targets can be built in the generated build directory "build_win" as usual:
e.g. "make egCAS"

Building under windows (only egcas until now)
=============================================
Install chocolatey package management. Install in chocolatey the winflexbison2 and pyhton2 package.
Install Qt Creator (choose mingw as compiler during installation).
execute pip install cogapp on command line.


switch to clang on linux (for compilation):
================================================
sudo update-alternatives --config c++
